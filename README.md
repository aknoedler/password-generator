# Password Generator

This project uses Javascript to generate a randomized password. The user enters a password length between 8 and 128 characters, then selects one or more types of characters to allow in the password (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, and special characters.) A random password with these parameters is generated and displayed.
